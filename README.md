# Data-Science

Important: I just started this project and it is heavily in progress. Any feedback is very welcome! 

Collection of IPython notebooks for people who are interested in learning about data science.
All notebooks aim at providing intuitive understanding, focusing on programming and keeping math to a minimum. 
The notebooks are designed with explanations and quizzes for self paced learning. Simply clone the repository and start working your way through the notebook. If you don't want to solve the quizzes, or are stuck, you can look at the executed version to see the solution.
